My name is Jenil Chaklasiya, and I am a 3rd-year international Computer Science student.  

I have worked in both technical and non-technical roles, including as a Project Support Office Intern at the Government of Saskatchewan, where I led a key project.  

I am passionate about working on meaningful projects and improving processes through innovative solutions.
